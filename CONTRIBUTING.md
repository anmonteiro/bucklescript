# Contributing

Thanks for your interest! Below we describe Melange's development setup for a few different package managers. If something isn't working, or you'd like to add another workflow, please let us know by filing an issue.

## Prerequisites

- The [Nix](https://nixos.org/) package manager

## Developing

The best way to get started is to get a `nix` shell running:

```sh
# Opens a shell with the necessary environment.
nix-shell --pure
```

> **Note**: You can also run `nix-shell --command $EDITOR` to get merlin support

Once you're in the shell, you have access to `dune`, `node`, `yarn`, and all the other executables you need to get down to business.

Before you try building with `dune`, be sure to install the local `ocaml-tree` project:

```sh
cd ocaml-tree && npm install
```

Here are some common commands you may find useful:

- `dune build` builds the whole project
- `dune runtest` runs the native tests
- `dune exec jscomp/main/js_main.exe` is useful to run the development version of `bsc`

When you are almost ready to open a PR, it's a good idea to run the full CI test suite locally to make sure everything works. First, open a new non-`nix` shell or exit your current `nix` shell by using the `exit` command or `ctrl+d`. Then, run the following command:

```sh
# Runs the full CI test suite
nix-build nix/ci/test.nix
```

If that all passes, then congratulations! You are well on your way to becoming a contributor ðŸŽ‰
